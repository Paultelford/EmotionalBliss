						<li>Insofar as it may be established that there was no defect in the goods at the point of collection to you, we reserve the right to charge you £15 as a contribution towards the cost of inspecting and testing the goods.</li>
						<li>Insofar as the age or condition of the goods is such that we are unable to accept their return, we will redeliver the goods to you prior to dispatch. You agree to pay to us the reasonable cost of re-delivering the goods to you.</li>
