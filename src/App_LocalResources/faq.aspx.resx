    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Our understanding of women’s arousal and orgasms has grown substantially over the past 10 to 15 years, but the basic design of most vibrators hasn’t changed in decades.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Working with well-respected sex therapist Julia Cole, Relate and the BASRT (The British Association for Sexual and Relationship Therapy), we set out to create a range of intimate massagers that did more than simply look good. So many companies talk solely about design, but we decided to let function, shape and texture be our guide to creating our intimate massagers. Designers can produce visually inspiring products, but if they don’t work, what’s the point? 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Our intimate massagers look different, because they are different.</value>

    <value>Our intimate massagers are not “novelty” items, but we are sure you will have fun with them. Three years of research have gone into creating and improving our products. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The collaboration with experts Julia Cole, Relate and the BASRT gave us the opportunity to create a range of products that focus on women’ s needs. So, we concentrate on stimulating the external nerve endings around the clitoris and vaginal lips, rather than internally, where most people believe the stimulation comes from - the infamous “G Spot”, for example, is a much-debated topic. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What we do know is that there are more nerve endings located between the clitoris and the anus on a woman than any other part of her body, hence the Emotional Bliss range of intimate massagers. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The plastic used in our intimate massagers is as close to the softness of natural skin and the vibrations are set at 80Hz, the frequency best known to arouse women. We’ve also tried to think green, and use environmentally friendly rechargeable batteries. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We hope that our intimate massagers will speak for themselves; below you can read in more detail the challenges we faced creating the Emotional Bliss range of intimate massagers.</value>

    <value>We would be delighted to sell our product on the high street; unfortunately in the UK the typical Sex Shop would not be appropriate as we are far removed from the conventional sex toy. We see ourselves as an exclusive quality brand that represents female sexual independence; unfortunately this type of proud bold statement is not supported in today’s High Street. 
&lt;br.&lt;br&gt;
If you know of any retail shops that are prepared to stand-up for female sexual independence, we would be more than happy to support them!

    <value>In the past men have purchased the traditional sex toy and then presented it to their wife or partner with a smile. Here at Emotional Bliss we consider the purchase of an EB intimate massager to be a personal and emotional experience. Most men believe that women achieve orgasm by intercourse alone, and for this reason the majority of them are not suited to selecting your EB intimate massager. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the men we have developed the Voucher System. By selecting a voucher of chosen value the purchaser then has the opportunity to type his (or her) private message. The message will next appear when the voucher is used.</value>
