WE hear a lot these days about how people can and should make love, but there 
are virtually no rules for good sex.
</h2><p class="article">
It isn't compulsory to have an orgasm. As long as a woman is left feeling 
satisfied, neither she nor her partner should feel that they have in any way 
failed because she hasn't had an orgasm. 
</p><p class="article">
Sex is for your pleasure, not to pass some test or keep up with the Jones's.
</p><p class="article">
Many women, however, while they enjoy intercourse with their partner, never or 
rarely reach orgasm, and are left feeling dissatisfied as a result.
</p><p class="article">
Women's problems over orgasm vary. Some women have never experienced an orgasm 
at all. This is often because they were brought up to think of sex as 
something not quite nice.
</p><p class="article">
Parents worried about daughters getting pregnant may keep impressing on them 
that they mustn't get carried away. 
</p><p class="article">
It is small wonder that, when they have a partner, they can't suddenly undo 
all those lessons to their sub-conscious.
</p><p class="article">
Before a woman who has never experienced an orgasm can help her partner to 
help her to climax, she has to learn for herself what pleases her. 
</p><p class="article">
Sex is a positive pleasure, and there is nothing wrong with enjoying it, even 
when you are alone.
</p><p class="article">
Having given yourself permission to enjoy your sexuality, you have to find out 
what turns you on, explore the effect of different caresses of the genital 
area. 
</p><p class="article">
There is nothing wrong with self-stimulation - in fact it is a basic part of 
the treatment prescribed by sex therapists.
</p><p class="article">
It's not stimulation of the vagina, by the way, but of the clitoris that leads 
to orgasm for most women - the clitoris is the little peak you can feel in 
the front of the vagina.
</p><p class="article">
When you have an orgasm it feels like an internal throbbing. 
</p><p class="article">
The intensity varies widely. It can be fierce and wild, it may be quiet and 
sensuous. The common denominator is it certainly should feel pleasurable.
</p><p class="article">
Some women learn how to masturbate, perhaps as teenagers, but find they are 
unable to reach a climax with their partner, even if he stimulates them in a 
similar way. 
</p><p class="article">
The most likely cause of this is a variation on the inhibited feelings 
mentioned before. 
</p><p class="article">
Their sub-conscious will not let them admit to anyone else that they are 
enjoying sex.
</p><p class="article">
Sharing regular sessions of all-over massage can help a couple start 
communicating physically and sexually. 
</p><p class="article">
Use a little cream or oil, massage and stroke one another all over. 
</p><p class="article">
Say what feels good and what not-so-good.
</p><p class="article">
When the time feels right, you can begin showing one another how to give the 
most pleasure by stroking and massaging the sexual areas, too. 
</p><p class="article">
The only rule is that you should both enjoy it.
</p><p class="article">
Modern-style vibrators designed especially to suit women&rsquo;s sexual responses 
can make a terrific difference. Check out <a href="http://www.emotionalbliss.co.uk"target="_blank">www.emotionalbliss.co.uk</a>.</p><p class="article">
Some women can climax when masturbating or when stimulated in some similar way 
by their partner, but cannot reach orgasm during intercourse. 
</p><p class="article">
In fact, this is normal, as only a minority of women do climax during 
intercourse. Most reach orgasm through other stimulation.
</p><p class="article">
Many couples have perfectly happy ways of making love which involve the man 
stimulating the woman until she climaxes, either before or after intercourse.
</p><p class="article">
It really doesn't matter how or when a woman reaches her climax, as long as 
she enjoys it, but if a couple feel that they very much would like the woman 
to climax during intercourse, they may find a change in position will help 
or he can caress her at the same time.
</p><p class="article">
The vagina has comparatively few nerve endings and the clitoris has many. 
</p><p class="article">
Basically, few women can possibly climax unless they are receiving some form 
of clitoral stimulation. 
</p><p class="article">
Of course, it is important for the man to be sure that the woman is really 
aroused before he attempts intercourse, so they must share lots of loving 
foreplay first.
</p><p class="article">
Also the man has to be able to sustain intercourse for a reasonable length of 
time, since it is important to keep stimulating a woman right up to and 
during orgasm. 
</p><p class="article">
If premature ejaculation is a problem, however, let me know because I can send 
you a free leaflet on how to solve the problem.
</p><p class="article">
Reaching a climax needs some muscle tension and you can give this a nudge in 
the right direction.
</p><p class="article">
</p><p class="article">
You need to have at least half an hour of foreplay to be sure the woman is 
fully aroused. 
</p><p class="article">
Then she shouldn&rsquo;t try to relax but tense the pelvic-floor muscle (if you&rsquo;re 
unsure how to do this, my free leaflet on increasing sexual sensation 
explains).
</p><p class="article">
If she then arches her back and puts her head back, this gets her body in the 
right position to reach climax, as long as her partner carries on pleasuring 
her.
</p><p class="article">
Assuming a couple feel free to experiment with what feels good to them, then 
they have a good chance of discovering what will lead to the woman achieving 
full sexual satisfaction pretty frequently, if not every time.
</p><p class="article">
However, some couples experiment with different positions and techniques and 
still draw a blank. 
</p><p class="article">
Too much alcohol can dry up the vaginal secretions and reduce the blood flow 
to the sex organs. 
</p><p class="article">
This in turn can make sex more painful and will affect a woman&rsquo;s ability to 
have an orgasm.
</p><p class="article">
Loss of orgasm can also be linked with major changes in a woman's life such as 
childbirth or the menopause. 
</p><p class="article">
Depression can severely damp down sexual feelings.
</p><p class="article">
It could be that she&rsquo;s had a bad sexual experience in the past or that there&rsquo;s 
some problem in her relationship with her partner, and unaided you can&rsquo;t 
stop it getting in the way.
</p><p class="article">
For more details about the help available, or if you want a step-by-step 
explanation of the self-help therapy suggested earlier, do write for my more 
detailed free leaflet on solving orgasm problems which explains all this and 
gives contacts for finding expert sex therapy.

Perhaps the best testimonial I ever had was from one woman who said that she 
had managed to achieve her first ever orgasm in 16 years of marriage through 
following the suggestions in that leaflet!
