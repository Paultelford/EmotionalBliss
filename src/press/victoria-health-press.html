				<h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">July Newsletter</h3>
				<div style="font-size: 1.1em ! important;">
					<p>Welcome to the July  newsletter where I report that most of you now have the gorgeous Electra  FitFlops on your feet and I join forces with Marcia Kilgore, creator of the  FitFlop, to bring you more news from the FitFlop camp. We have new launches,  some amazing product accolades and we preview Autumn exclusives.  We are also going to take a look at sexual  fulfillment and we introduce some new brands.  Let’s  go: </p>
					<p><strong><u>FitFlop Frenzy – The Wear Red  Campaign</u></strong><u>
						</u></p>
					<p>At the time of writing, the long-awaited consignment of Gold and Silver  Electras finally arrived and so I thank you for being so patient, I hope you  love them as much as we do and all I can really say is that all good things are  worth waiting for.  We are expecting  another massive delivery of the original WalkStars and The Gill within the next  seven days, so the minute they arrive we will send them out to you.  </p>
					<p>This month I join the irrepressible Marcia Kilgore, creator of the FitFlop,  for the <strong>Wear Red  Campaign</strong>.  So this Summer, if  you’re spotted wearing a pair of the classic red (CR) coloured FitFlops (by one  of our CRFF seekers) you’ll win a gift certificate for another free pair of  FitFlops, in any colour or style you choose.  That is, as long as we’ve got them to give you.  If we don’t, you’ll have to pick another  pair.  Tragic huh!<br/>
						<strong>FitFlops from £36</strong></p>
					<p>Fast forward to the Autumn Collection.  Keep cool, calm and collected.  I  already leaked a tiny bit of information in last month’s newsletter that there  will be a FitFlop clog, but this is going to be a clog like no other.  It is called ‘The Gogh’ (as in Vincent Van),  you are going to die when you see how gorgeous it is, there is little doubt in  my mind that it will be as iconic as the original red WalkStar and you  pronounce it like ‘go’.  </p>
					<p>The minute we have absolute confirmation as to when ‘The Gogh’ will be  available, we will send you notification via this newsletter (subscribe now –  it’s free!) and I will put it on the front of our site so you can  pre-order.  Please, please understand  that pre-order means you will be on a waiting list, so in the name of sanity  (yours and mine), just know that we do not debit any monies until the day your  order is processed and sent and that you will be amongst the first people in  the world to get them on your feet. </p>
					
					<p><strong><u>Emotional Bliss</u></strong></p>
					<p>One of the most common problems in men and women is loss  of libido, closely followed by an inability to achieve orgasm.  Often regarded as a taboo subject, sexual  fulfillment is one of the leading health concerns we are asked to address, so  please read this and view it as a prelude to Sarah Stacey’s  poignant and practical feature appearing this month in The Mail on Sunday YOU  Magazine.  You will not want to miss it,  but for now, read on:</p>
					<p>A healthy sex life is not only extremely enjoyable, but it does wonders for  your health in general.  The release of  an orgasm boosts the immune system as well as flooding your body with ‘feel  good’ endorphins.</p>
					<p>After five years of research, Emotional Bliss has just launched a new  ‘heat’ range of intimate massagers.  Their aim is to encourage women of all ages to  banish embarrassment and to finally feel comfortable about buying a  vibrator.  The range was developed in  conjunction with Julia Cole, a qualified couples counsellor and psychosexual  therapist, who believes that every woman deserves personal sexual satisfaction,  whether she is in a relationship or not.</p>
					<p>There are four different options to choose from:</p>
					<p>The Isis:  The smallest rechargeable finger-fitting  massager in the world designed for use on your own or with your partner.  The Isis is  fully rechargeable providing 2-3 hours of enjoyment and is practically  silent.  Isis  is a perfect choice for the beginner or to enjoy with your partner during  lovemaking.<br/>
						<strong>The Isis £25</strong></p>
					<p>The Chandra: Slightly larger than the Isis, this produces a more intense vibration and is fully  rechargeable providing 1-2 hours of enjoyment.<br/>
						<strong>The  Chandra £25</strong></p>
					<p>Femblossom:  The first of the two new ‘Heat’ range, the vibrating sensations are  totally unique to the Femblossom and the curved shape has been designed to  create intense stimulation throughout the whole  vulval area.<br/>
						<strong>Femblossom £49.95</strong>
					</p>
					<p>Womolia: The Womolia is for women who like to be  in total control of their pleasure and is the second of the two new ‘Heat’  range.  <br/>
						<strong>Womolia £49.95</strong></p>
					<p>A VH tester declares: ‘I am having a little rave  about the Emotional Bliss products.  You  can really see the thought that's gone into them. No tacky reds or pinks, they  are designed for what women really want and they are rechargeable. Batteries  are so dreadful, they are okay for kids' toys, but not for grown-ups’.   Each of the Emotional Bliss range comes beautifully packaged and will be delivered to  you in a discreet VH box.  Additionally, we recommend the following two supplements  for lack of libido: </p>
					<p><u><strong>For Women</strong></u><strong>:  </strong></p>
					<p>Maca is a turnip-shaped vegetable from the mustard  family found in Peru.  According to Chris Kilham, aka The Medicine  Hunter, ‘Maca contains powerful sex-enhancing substances that occur nowhere  else in nature.  If you can use a plant  and not an alien substance, that’s a good option.  These plants deliver the goods”.<br/>
						<strong>Maca by LifeTime Vitamins £16.95 for 120 Capsules</strong></p>
					<p><u><strong>For Men</strong></u><strong>:</strong></p>
					<p>Chris Kilham introduced us to LongJax (also known  as Tongkat Ali).  He states ‘this root  from Malaysia  and throughout southeast Asia radically improves erectile function, increases  testosterone, and cranks up ATP, the body’s primary energy unit.  The result?  Nature’s Viagra”.<br/>
						<strong>LongJax by Dr’s A-Z £29.95 for 30 Capsules</strong></p>
					<p>Before we move on to the next sector of this  newsletter, let me just tell you a little more about Chris Kilham.  Chris travels the world in search of traditional,  plant-based medicines, and works with shamans, healers, growers, harvesters,  scientists, trade officials and other plant medicine experts in dozens of  countries. This work always involves a collaboration of talented people.  </p>
					<p>In  a recent article published in The New York Times, he said ‘I want people using  safer medicine.  And that means plant  medicine’.<br/>
Dr  Andrew Weil (see the <strong>Dr Weil</strong> section  on our site) says “Chris Kilham is a trustworthy guide on the medicine trail,  full of enthusiasm, wonder and respect for the wisdom of traditional  cultures.  I respect his mission to make  these plants and their uses better known in our culture".</p>
					<p>Shabir  and I have known Chris for many years and our paths crossed again, when we  discovered LifeFlower (now known as Erigeron Breviscapinus) separately, but at  the same moment in time:  </p>
					<p>“This is one of the most  remarkable plants I have ever encountered”, says Chris.  “I think that every artist wants to paint a  masterpiece, every musician wants a platinum CD, and every medical researcher  wants to be in on a life-saving medical discovery.  In my estimation, LifeFlower is that  life-saving medical discovery in my career. Erigeron breviscapinus helps stroke  patients to recover function when they have suffered paralysis.  It also enhances brain function in the  healthy.  This is huge”.  <br/>
						<strong>Erigeron Breviscapinus £31.95 for 30 Capsules</strong></p>
					
					<p>Finally,  I am leaving you with the latest quote from Marcia Kilgore:  ‘FitFlops are the biomechanical  messiah’.  This after many, many emails  saying that FitFlops have helped to alleviate many common health concerns such  as sciatica and back pain and for bringing a smile to the faces of people who  don’t have to wear their orthotics now they have FitFlops.  As one national magazine editor said to me,  ‘let’s nominate Marcia for the Nobel Prize for services to womanhood’.  Yep, let’s do that thing.  Attagirl Marcia!</p>
					<p>As  ever, Shabir and I, together with the entire VH team, thank each and every one  of you for supporting us, most especially because due to exceptional rampaging  on your part, a whole load of manufacturers have been struggling to keep up  with your demands and  many leading  products have been out of stock.  </p>
					<p>I  think we are through the worst of it now, er, with the exception of the <strong>Lipo-Contour Slimming Pants</strong>.  They should be with us within the next ten  days and if they are not, you will hear me screaming at the manufacturers from  wherever you live!</p>
					<p>Have a  fabulous July.</p>
					<p>Gill x </p>
